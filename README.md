  Our project is a Pharmacy Management System that allows users to search for pharmacies that have the medicine they want and check them out using Java.
  We use concepts that we have learned in our OOP lesson like classes encapsulation and inheritance.   To run this project, compile the Main.java file and run the application in any Java IDE.
